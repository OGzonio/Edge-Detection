The code performs edge detection on an input image using the Sobel operator.

The first step is to load the image using the OpenCV cv2.imread() function and resize it to a fixed size of 550x440 pixels using the cv2.resize() function. The image is then converted to grayscale using the cv2.cvtColor() function.

The next step is to pad the image with zeros around the edges using the numpy np.pad() function. This is done so that the Sobel operator can be applied to all pixels in the image, including those at the edges.

Two 3x3 Sobel filters are defined for detecting horizontal and vertical edges respectively. These filters are represented as numpy arrays and are used to compute the gradients in the horizontal and vertical directions.

Two arrays are created to hold the horizontal and vertical edge information, initialized to zeros using the numpy np.zeros_like() function.

A nested loop is used to iterate over each pixel in the image, excluding the padded edges. For each pixel, a 3x3 neighborhood is extracted from the padded image, and the Sobel filters are convolved with the neighborhood using numpy's np.multiply() function to compute the horizontal and vertical edge information.

The magnitude of the edges at each pixel is computed using the horizontal and vertical edge information. The magnitude is normalized to the range [0, 255] and converted to an unsigned 8-bit integer using numpy's np.uint8() function.
